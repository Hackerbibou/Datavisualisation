   I spent around 1 hour and 30 minutes on loading the apis and fully customizing every graph. Then, I spent around 2 hours modifying the UI and styling every component.
   If I had more time to complete this test, I would probably work more on the user interface as I wanted to make it as simple as I can, due to the time conflict. I would make the app screensize responsive and test it with different screen sizes, also check if there might be bugs using different devices.

   Why did you use the libraries you did?

   React query: I used react query to load the data as it is very easy to use and don't need to worry about cache or extra data loading properties.

   Rechart: Rechart is the most popular charting library among professionals and it is very easy to use or to understand. I was using d3.js at first, however, after running through some rendering problems, I tried rechart and it was able to render the graph properly.

   jQuery: I used jQuery to easily modify the pages by hiding charts the user did not request to see and show what the ones requested

   What was the reasoning behind the type(s) of graph you used?

   I used bar and line graphs because line graphs are useful for displaying smaller changes in a trend over time while Bar graphs are better for comparing larger changes or differences in data among groups. Since the data had a lot of small changes, I used line charts to display the trends and since it took me little time to do so, I decided to add bar charts.
